# luftdaten-display
It is a web application that visualizes the data from http://archive.luftdaten.info. You can either host it on a web server or download and execute it locally. You can get a release here: https://github.com/toncho11/luftdaten-display/archive/master.zip. Once downloaded click on the get_single_sensor_data.html and fill the ID of a SDS011 sensor.

The current implementation is in HTML and Javascript(Ajax). The project does not use a server side programming language such as PHP neither a database. The advatage is that it can be used locally without the need to be hosted on a web-server and without the need of installing anything.
